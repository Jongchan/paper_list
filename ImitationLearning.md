1. Observational Learning by Reinforcement Learning [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06617.pdf)]<br/>
A toy example of not knowing the reward location, but provided the behavior of the 'teacher'.
2. Third Person Imitation Learning, ICLR2017 [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01703.pdf)]<br/>
A toy example in 3D reaching tasks&pendulum. Expert trajectories are provided in different view point. Formulated the imitation learning into domain adaptation problem.
3. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03476.pdf)] [[Github, Theano implementation](https://github.com/openai/imitation)]<br/>
Formulated imitation learning into GAN formulation. Use GAN w/ policy gradient to solve imitation learning problem.
4. Inferring the Latent Structure of Human Decision-Making from Raw Visual Inputs [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08840.pdf)] [[Github, Tensorflow](https://github.com/YunzhuLi/InfoGAIL)]<br/>
Using InfoGAN structure & ResNet feature & aux info & latent code to learn/infer different driving styles. An extension of GAIL into more complex tasks of TORCS.
